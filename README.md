so they can share their content and interact with other posts from other users.

## Planning Story

As a group we chose to tackle the message board prompt and we decided to try
and reproduce a simplistic version of a Reddit-like message board. Once we built
a working backend API with which we could CRUD on multiple resources, we
began working on the front-ent by brainstorming the various routes and components
that needed to be built for the React app. Once we knew what components needed
to be created and rendered, we each focused on a resource and built the frontend
components to successfully CRUD on these resources.

We ran into an interesting bug when we tried to run an axios API call within a
useEffect hooks function that didn't have a dependency array. The component to
which this function belonged to was never unmounted, but sat in the background of
two bootstrap modal components which had their own respective resource crud actions.
Upon successful submission of these forms, the modals would disappear and the
original component would correctly display the new API index call which it was
making; however, this wasn't an ideal behavior as the useEffect function was
running in an infinite loop. To fix this bug we decided to include the modal
components as part of the original component making the infinite API calls so
that we could toggle some state parameters to selectively set off the API call
that was originally running on repeat.
